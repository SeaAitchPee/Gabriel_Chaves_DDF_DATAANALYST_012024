      "316 Stainless Steel Fully Threaded Rod, 1/2\"-13 Thread Size, 72\" Length, Right Hand Threads Product Description This fully threaded rod is made of 316 stainless steel, has 1/2\"-13 right-hand threads, and is 72\" long. The 316 stainless steel grade provides strength and offers better corrosion resistance than 18-8 stainless steel, especially in marine environments. The material may be slightly magnetic. Threaded rods and studs are fasteners that screw into threaded nuts or tapped holes, allowing for assembly of components. The difference between rods and studs is length: In general, a stud is up to 1 foot long, and a rod is more than 1 foot long. Both have threads along part or all of their length. Those that are partially threaded have equal or unequal thread lengths on one or both ends. Studs are also available with a perforated base, weld projections, or a press-in captive head for securing to the surface of a component. Product Description This fully threaded rod is made of 316 stainless steel, has 1/2\"-13 right-hand threads, and is 72\" long. The 316 stainless steel grade provides strength and offers better corrosion resistance than 18-8 stainless steel, especially in marine environments. The material may be slightly magnetic.

      "32\" x 30\" 2.5\" Heavy Duty Washer Machine Drain Pan, Stainless Steel Fine (With Hole) Product Description TIRED OF MOPPING UP PUDDLES OF WATER Every Time YOU DO THE LAUNDRY? It's time to get the laundry done and you load up your dirty clothes into your washing machine. As time passes, you notice puddles of water starting to accumulate under your washer, forcing you to place piles of rags underneath to keep your floors dry. If you want to do laundry without having to mop wet floors, using a drain pan is the perfect solution. The Washer Machine Drain Pan by DR Quality Parts keeps your laundry room floor clean and dry. LASTS MANY YEARS Ordinary plastic drain pans tend to become brittle after years of use. Bearing the heavy weight of your washers, plastic drain pans can also crack over time – causing water to leak out and mess up your floors. This drain pan is made of thick 304 stainless steel that will not rust, corrode, stain, or harbor unwanted odors – promising many years of reliability and durability. CHILD & PET-FRIENDLY DESIGN If you have kids and pets running around your home, you want to keep your living space free from all sorts of safety hazards to prevent accidents and injuries. Some metal drain pans have sharp edges that can harm and scratch small children and pets. Our metal drain pan features blunt, hemmed edges that ensure safe use and provide added rigidity to the whole structure. VERSATILE USE Measuring 32” x 30” x 2.5”, this drain pan can easily accommodate all brands of washing machines and dryers, as long as their base does not exceed 31.75\" x 29.75” in measurement. Pan comes with a pre-punched 1.25” drain hole for a standard PVC drain fitting (included) on the 30-inch side. Larger hole than other pans for easy water flow and to prevent backlogs. Please note that this drain pan won’t bend or conform if used on machines that do not match the dimensions, so measure your washer carefully before making a purchase. It is also not recommended for washers with pedestals, as the drawer will hit the pan. HERE ARE MORE REASONS WHY YOU NEED THIS STAINLESS STEEL WASHER DRAIN PAN: RELIABLE FLOOR PROTECTION A buildup of water on your floor can create unsightly water spots and give off a foul smell over time. If left unchecked, accumulated water can also rot your precious wooden floors and loosen up your floor tiles. This stainless steel drain pan is all about keeping you flooring dry and immaculate, so your home stays clean and mess-free. It also reduces the risk of slipping due to puddles. EASY TO CLEAN, REDUCE MACHINE SLIPPING & SLIDING To clean the drain pan, just wipe it off with a sponge or a dry cloth to absorb any liquid residue. To prevent water from building up and filling up the drain pan, you may cut a hole on the side and install a drain tube where accumulated water can easily flow out. You may also attach rubber grips underneath the drain pad to prevent your washing machine or dryer from sliding out of place, especially during the wash or spin cycles. ELEGANT, LUXURIOUS DESIGN Compared to other metal drain pans that have a dull and faded look, our metal drain pan has a glossy and polished finish, scoring style points for your kitchen or laundry area. This drain pan makes an excellent Christmas, Thanksgiving, or birthday present for homeowners who are looking to protect their floors from water leaking out of their washing machine or spin dryer. ;;;;\n",

      "Glamore Magnetic Car Phone Mount, Magnetic Phone Car Mount, Car Phone Mount Magnetic, Magnetic Car Mount Holder (1 Pack) Product Description Q1. How to use this magneic car phone mount? First, insert the magnetic car mount holder into the air vent, twist lock and securely tighten it. Second, tear off the sticker of the included magnetic metal plate, then stick the magnetic metal plate directly on the back of your phone, then place your phone on the magnetic area of the car holder, then you are ready to go. Q2. How much weight, in terms of the weight of phone and case, can the mount hold? I've been using the car phone mount for months. I followed the seller's instruction for the mount, first tear the sticker of the magnetic metal plate, stick it directly on the back of my phone, then put the case one. It works like a charm. It easily holds my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (huge and heavy phone) very well with case on (even more huge and heavy), so I think it can easily and safely hold almost any phone on the market. Q3. Would the air vent car phone works with every kind of air vent? Is the car phone mount able to rotate? The car phone mount doesn't work with all of the air vents.You will have to check the photos shown by the seller of the applicable air vents for the car mount before purchase. The magneticc mount can rotate 360 degrees, you can simply adjust the display as you please. I am sure you would be happy with it. Q4. This car phone mount includes 2 magnetic metal plates in a small platic bag. Are both metal pads go on the phone because I already did that and can't get it unstuck. What should I do? How do I remove the adhesive metal plate? Hello, I am sorry about that, you can place just one pad on your phone, but if you want it to be more firmly to hold your phone, you can stuck 2 metal plates to your phone. If you want to get them off, it's easier to use the hairdryer to make it unstuck. I would use a heat gun (be careful) and dental floss or fishing line. It would be helpful to use a hair dryer to carefully warm and soften the adhesive,then peel the adhesive metal plate off gently. Hope this helps. Q5. Are there any history of the magnetic car phone causing trouble with phone functions or GPS service? I understand your concern. There is nothing wrong with using magnets around electronics. This has been the case for decades. It would take a very powerful strong magnet intensive to harm a hard drive which is where the warning came from. Cell phones all use solid state storage so the magnet of the car mount is not an issue to cause trouble with phone functions or GPS service. Perfect Road Companion.

Begin by pushing back the cuticles and cleaning the nail plate - removing any hangnails or dead tissue. Cleanse the nails with OPI Expert Touch Nail Wipe saturated with N.A.S 99 Nail Cleansing Solution to get perfectly prepped nails. Why do I get bubbles in my manicure? For best nail art results, always allow each coat to dry before applying the next coat of Nail Lacquer. If the previous coats are still wet, they will continue to dry under the new coat of polish, resulting in air bubbles getting trapped in between. Why does my Nail Lacquer get thick? Nail Lacquer contains solvents which evaporate with use and cause your nail polish to get thick. Use Nail Lacquer thinner to replace the evaporated solvents and you're good to go again! How do I remove cuticle flooding? Easily remove OPI Nail Lacquer nail polish from the skin by dipping a brush or Q-tip into Expert Touch Lacquer Remover and cleaning around the cuticle to remove excess nail polish. Why is my Nail Lacquer nail polish streaky? Make sure to apply OPI Nail Lacquer using the Three Stroke Method to avoid streaking and create an even application. Start by taking enough color on the brush for your three stokes, but not too much to flood the cuticles. Apply on center then sides.

They created partnerships and joint ventures in China, which still exist today. Read more ;;;;\n",

Bi-Lingual Caller ID When the phone rings on one side of the room and you're on the other, advanced Talking Caller ID clearly tells you who's calling with text-to-speech announcements in English and Spanish from speakers in the base unit and handsets. Read more Improved Design The sleek metallic black base unit and bright, backlit handset LCDs have been redesigned to make calling even more convenient. The base unit's minimal footprint maximizes desk, countertop or table space. Dial keys and numbers are enlarged for faster, easier use. All-Digital Voicemail with Message Counter Recording, retrieving and storing voicemail is easy with a digital capacity of up to 18 minutes of messaging. A bright message counter on the base unit lets you know how many messages you have. You'll also know instantly how many messages you have received with a large, easy-to-read message counter on the phone system's elegant base unit. Ringer IDs Select a ringer from the system's library to link individual ringtones to your pre-programmed phone book entries. Your assigned pre-programmed ringtones will sound when corresponding Caller ID numbers are received from incoming calls. Extend Talk Time With the system's Intelligent Eco Mode, handset power consumption lowers automatically on the handset nearest to the base unit.

Rug shedding is common with some newer rugs but this will lessen over time with regular vacuuming. SPOT CLEAN AS NEEDED Clean spills immediately by blotting with a clean, dry white cloth. For hard to remove stains we recommend that the rug be professionally cleaned. USE A RUG PAD A non-slip rug pad’s primary benefits are safety and cushioning. However, it also prolongs the life of your rug and makes it easier to vacuum. TAME THE SHAG A great tip for cleaning a shag rug is to turn it upside down and vacuum the back with the beater bar setting. This will shake loose all the dirt and dust. Once done, move the rug and vacuum up all the dirt that came loose onto the floor. Read more ;;;;\n",

We believe our products can enhance one's quality of life and help tap into the full potential of both mind and body. Previous page Natural Shilajit Resin Sourced from the Altai Mountains, considered by some the “Green Pharmacy” of the earth and the “Lungs” of the planet. New Product - Samadhi Tonic 100% Plant-based tonic made with 9 superfoods, herbs and adaptogens; formulated to support and strengthen the key systems of the body. Why do we love what we do? If you want to naturally experience high energy, eliminate toxins, help the body absorb nutrients better, then Natural Shilajit Resin is for you. What problem are we solving? Our main goal is to get Natural Shilajit Resin the attention it deserves by introducing as many people as possible to shilajit and educating them on its countless health benefits. What makes our products unique? 100% Pure Natural Shilajit, also known as \"GRADE A+” is carefully and consciously gathered from the pristine regions of the Altai Mountains. A Gift from Mother Nature. Each new batch of shilajit goes through vigorous testing to ensure contaminants like PCBs, furans, and dioxins are below the limits defined by European Union before being processed & packed here in California.

Each new batch of shilajit goes through vigorous testing to ensure contaminants like PCBs, furans, and dioxins are below the limits defined by European Union and California Proposition 65 before being processed & packed here in California. OUR SHILAJIT CONTAINS OVER 72 FULVIC HUMIC TRACE MINERALS, TRACE VITAMINS, AND 18 AMINO ACIDS. In addition, Natural Shilajit contains a large number of minerals, amino acids, Fulvic and Humic Acids, vitamins A, B, C, and P (citrines), phospholipids, and polyphenol complexes, terpenoids. Also present are microelements (zinc, manganese, chrome, iron, magnesium, and others). Natural Shilajit Resin Contains Large Number Of Minerals, Vitamins, amino Acids, Fulvic & Humic Acids. ENHANCES ENERGY & MOOD Deficiency of certain minerals and vitamins in diet produces symptoms such as tiredness, fogginess, and make you slow and lethargic when it comes to exercise. Shilajit resin is a quick fix for people suffering from a deficiency of one element or the other, as it boasts no less than 85 trace elements, lots of phytonutrients, full-spectrum amino acids, and enzymes. PROMOTES ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY Natural Shilajit resin is very rich in Zinc and iron. These two minerals promote gut health as they support the growth of gut bacteria (flora) and also increase the level of butyrate, a beneficial metabolite that helps fight against free radicals. Zinc, another constituent of Shilajit, is important in the production of digestive enzymes. INCREASES FOCUS & MENTAL CLARITY Minerals play a vital biochemical role in your brain and are required for normal cognitive function. Some minerals not only prevent brain disease and impairment but also help ensure optimal functioning of the brain. Nourishing the brain with the proper amount of vitamins and minerals increases your ability to concentrate and focus. ENHANCES BRAIN POWER & COGNITION Natural Shilajit resin boosts the body’s immunity to combat foreign agents that cause diseases in the body. Both selenium and zinc protect the body against free radicals, which are harmful compounds (invaders) that can eventually lower immune function. Free radicals burden the immune system of the body since they make it fight off illness rather than energizing and protecting the body. Read more THE MOST TRUSTED AND REPUTABLE SHILAJIT BRAND ON THE U.S. MARKET. We genuinely believe our product can enhance one's quality of life and help tap into the full potential of both mind and body. And all of that comes from a natural source, not some chemistry lab. Shilajit is truly a gift from Mother Nature, and we're just here to deliver it to your doorstep. RESPONSIBLY SOURCED. All of our Shilajit is 100% natural and wild-crafted. We work directly with our long-time trusted supplier in The Altai Mountains to be extra confident in the product's authenticity. How to Take Natural Resin Shilajit? 1. Find Your Shilajit Dosage. To find your optimal dosage, begin by taking a piece about the size of a grain of rice once daily. Then, take the same amount 2-3 times per day in a few days. Then gradually increase the amount of shilajit taken with each dose to a large pea size until you achieve the desired benefits. 2. Take a Pea-Size Portion/ Using a measuring stick, take a pea-sized portion of natural shilajit resin. Each box comes with a measuring stick and user manual. To maximize absorption, we suggest taking your dosage of shilajit resin on an empty stomach in the morning. Remember, consistency is the key to obtaining a healthy, fit, happy lifestyle. 3. Enjoy the Delicious, Healing Drink. The temperature or type of your drink does not affect the properties of shilajit resin, but it dissolves better in warm beverages. Remember, never boil the shilajit. There is approximately a 3-4 week period for the therapeutic effects to be noticed. Natural shilajit resin is susceptible to air. Therefore, avoid exposing it to air, heat, and light. To reduce the likelihood of drying out, keep the jar tightly closed.

      "Dragon Ball Z - Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan (Uncut) [DVD] Product Description Product Description Uncut International Amazon.com In the eighth Dragon Ball movie (1993), King Kai summons Goku to stop a Super Saiyan who's laid waste to the South Galaxy, and who plans to attack Earth. Paragas arrives and implores Vegeta to rule a re-created Planet Vegeta. Paragas's son Broly was born on the same day as Goku, but at a power level of 10,000! Fearing this potential menace, Vegeta's father ordered the child killed, but he escaped with Paragus. Now the pair is seeking revenge. After the standard battles, in which characters blast each other through solid rock, Goku defeats his legendary foe--with help from Gohan, Trunks, Piccolo, and (reluctantly) Vegeta. The most surprising images in the film depict not Broly's feats of super-strength, but Goku, incongruously clad in a suit and tie for an interview at the school Chi-Chi wants Gohan to attend.
